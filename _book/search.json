Some examples include:\nWhat makes time series special is that time is not just a variable, It carries important structure and dependencies. What happened today can depend on what happened yesterday, last month or even last year. This temporal uniqueness is what makes time series very powerful.",

    "text": "1.3 Traditional vs. Tidy Approach\nHistorically, time series in R has been handled using ts objects and packages like forecast. These are still useful, but they do not fit perfectly with the modern tidy philosophy; data frames, pipelines and consistent syntax.\nWe will follow the tidy time series workflow using the tidyverse ecosystem. The workflow uses packages from the tidyverts ecosystem:\n\ntsibble: A tidy data structure for time series (like a tibble but with special time handling)\nfable: For forecasting models (ARIMA, ETS, etc) in a tidy way.\nfeasts: For exploratory analysis (seasonal plots, decomposition, autocorrelation).\nlubridate: For working with dates and times.\nggplot2: For beautiful and flexible visualisations\ndplyr/tidyr/tibble: For general data wrangling\n\n\n1.3.1 The Tidy Time Series Workflow\nThe tidyverse ecosystem in R emphasises clean, readable code and consistent data structure. For time series, the modern approach uses the tidyverts suite of packages.\nThe typical flow we will follow includes:\n\n🔧 Data Preparation: Load and tidy data. Convert the data to a tsibble object so R knows how to handle time.\n🔍 Explore: Visualise trends, seasonality, patterns\n🧩 Decompose: Break down components (trends, seasonal, noise)\n🖥️ Model: Fit forecasting models (simple —&gt; advanced)\n📈 Forecast: Generate future predictions\n📏 Evaluate: Check how good the forecasts are (accuracy assessment)\n\nThis workflow is clean, consistent and integrates smoothly with other tidyverse tools you might already know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\ntidyverse: collection of packages designed for general data science\ntidyverts: collection of packages specifically for time series analysis\nThey all follow the tidy philosophy, structure and grammar\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Data We Will Use\nWe will start with some built-in datasets from the tsibble package so every on can follow along without downloading external files:\n\naus_production — Quarterly production values for Australian industries.\ntourism — Quarterly overnight trips in different Australian regions.\n\nLater, we shall also show how to use real-life datasets — for example, population growth or GDP growth data from Ghana, to make the examples relatable and practical\nYou can download the datasets used here gh_data.csv .\n\n\n1.3.3 What You Will Need to Follow Along\n\nBasic R Knowledge: You should know how to load packages, run functions, and work with data frames\nRStudio installed for a smooth workflow\nInternet connection (for package installation and possible data download)\n\n\n1.3.3.1 By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n\nHandle date/time data with ease\nExplore time series visually and statistically\nBuild forecasts using tidyverse-style functions\nApply your skills to your own datasets in research or work",
