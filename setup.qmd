# Setting Up {#sec-setting-up}

Before diving into analysis, let;s make sure we have all the **tools** we need to get ready. We need to set up our R environment with the right tools. The **`tidyverts`** ecosystem — built around the **`Tidyverse`** — makes time series analysis intuitive, consistent and visual.

This section will cover installing and loading the packages we will use and checking that your R environment is prepared for a smooth time series work

We will address the following:

-   @sec-required-packages: This part will cover all the packages we will need, how to install and load them for use in our R environment.
-   @sec-setting-up-your-rstudio-environment: Here you will see how to keep things organised in a more seamless and orderly manner on your system.

After going through this section you should have been able to **install and load** all required packages, make RStudio r**eady for your time series coding** and then been able able to **successfully load a test** dataset.
